        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>The "Lights Out" game was implemented using JavaScript with CSS for styling and HTML for structure. The board is a 5x5 grid of toggleable squares. Clicking a square toggles it and its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) between black (off) and white (on). When all lights are white, a pop-up message says “You win!”</p>
        <p>To ensure solvability, the game starts with an all-white board and then simulates 20 random valid toggles. The New Game button resets the board and starts a new solvable game. Styling uses a CSS class <code>is-off</code> to represent black tiles. Edge-wrapping was avoided using column checks. A timestamp and footer were added per project instructions.</p>
